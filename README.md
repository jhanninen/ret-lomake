# Kulukorvauslomake

This repository contains the app to generate expense reports for the scouting group Ruokolahden Er√§toverit ry.

Currently, the app is designed to do everything on the frontend to be served as static files, because the costs should be zero. Therefore, the app doesn't contain any authentication, but just a simple blocker question to prevent the most stupid trolls... :) In the future, there'll be some more sophisticated method if some backend could be deployed for the project.
